# 👋 Hi, I'm Joshua Percival

I’m an aspiring Cloud Support / Cloud Analyst professional currently developing hands-on skills in AWS and cloud architecture. I come from customer-facing and operational roles, and now I’m working towards my first role in cloud by building real projects, improving my technical foundations, and earning AWS certifications.

I enjoy understanding how things work, communicating clearly, and breaking down problems — the parts of tech that feel the most human. My goal is to move into an architecture-focused role over time, where I can help people make sense of technical solutions.

## 🌥️ What I'm Currently Working On
- Strengthening my AWS fundamentals (IAM, S3, EC2, VPC, CloudFront, Lambda basics)  
- Learning how to design clear and understandable cloud architectures  
- Building small practical projects to grow my portfolio  
- Developing Linux and networking basics  
- Preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect – Associate certification

## 📘 Certifications
- **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (2025)**  
- **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate (In progress, target Feb 2026)**

## 🏗️ What You'll Find Here (Soon)
I’m gradually building a collection of:
- Architecture diagrams  
- Small AWS projects  
- Notes from my learning journey  
- Experiments with serverless, networking, and cost-effective setups  

Everything is added as I learn it; nothing rushed, nothing fake. Just real progress over time.

## 🎯 My Current Focus
- Complete the SAA exam
- Build meaningful cloud architecture projects
- Strengthen troubleshooting skills
- Move into a Cloud Support or Cloud Analyst role
- Keep improving until I’m ready for an architect/advisory path
